# 🧠 AWS Cloud Portfolio

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Portfolio! This repository has been broken out into multiple repos. This is so I could segregate my projects into individual items, and make it easier to manage. Here is a list of my AWS Projects. Thank you
---

| Project | Description | Core Services Used | Project Status |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|[Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/jayshun2/Cloud-Resume-Challenge)| (Repo is currently private. Security audit before release is required to ensure no leaked credentials, sorry!) The Cloud Resume Challenge is a full-stack cloud engineering project that guides you through building and deploying a personal resume website entirely in the cloud. It involves using services like AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB to create a secure, scalable, and dynamic site. You write infrastructure as code with tools like Terraform and automate deployments with GitHub Actions, demonstrating real-world DevOps practices. Designed to showcase your practical skills, the challenge helps you build a professional portfolio project that proves your ability to design and manage cloud infrastructure from end to end. | S3, CloudFront, Route53, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB | In Progress |
| [S3 Static Website](https://github.com/jayshun2/s3StaticWebsite) | The static website at hello.awsportfolio.jayfrench.cloud is a simple, fast-loading personal site hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered securely via CloudFront. | S3, CloudFront, Route53, ACM | Completed |
| [Pre-Signed URLs](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ002-S3PreSignedURL) | The pre-signed URL project uses the AWS CLI to generate secure, time-limited URLs that grant temporary access to private objects stored in an S3 bucket. The project demonstrates how to control access at the object level using pre-signed URLs directly from the command line, showing how AWS handles fine-grained access without making the files public. | S3, IAM, AWS CLI | Completed |
| [EC2 SSH](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ003-EC2_SSH) | This project walks through launching a Linux-based EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and securely connecting to it via SSH. This is a foundational skill for anyone getting started with AWS or cloud infrastructure. You'll gain practical experience with virtual machines, secure access control, and basic network configuration in the AWS environment. | EC2, VPC, Security Groups, Key Pairs | Completed |
| [VPC Public and Private Subnets](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ004-VPC-Subnets) | Create a secure and scalable AWS network using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets. This project demonstrates how to separate internet-facing resources from internal infrastructure using best practices like NAT gateways, route tables, and subnet isolation. | VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway (IGW), NAT Gateway, Route Tables, EC2 | Completed |
| [IAM Access - GUI, CLI, and Terraform](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ005-iam-access) | This repository contains three implementations—GUI, CLI, and Terraform—for creating IAM users, groups, and roles with fine-grained permissions in AWS. Each version demonstrates a different way to manage secure access control using best practices. | IAM, AWS CLI, Terraform, IAM Policies, IAM Roles | Completed |
| [Set up and test an S3 lifecycle policy for storage class transitions](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ006-S3-Lifecycle-Policies/) | This project sets up an Amazon S3 lifecycle policy that automatically transitions files between storage classes, helping reduce costs as data ages. It also includes testing and verification using S3 Inventory to ensure the policy works as intended. | S3, S3 Policies | Building now, project delivery by 8/11/2025 |
| CloudWatch alarms for EC2 CPU usage | | CloudWatch, EC2 | Planning |
| S3 versioning and MFA Delete | | S3 | Planning |
| Tracking API activity on account with CloudTrail | | AWS CLI, CloudTrail | Planning |
| AWS Budgets and Cost Alerts | | | Planning |
