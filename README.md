# ðŸ§  AWS Cloud Portfolio

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Portfolio! This repository has been broken out into multiple repos. This is so I could segregate my projects into individual items, and make it easier to manage. Here is a list of my AWS Projects. Thank you

| Project | Description | Core Services Used | Project Status |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|[Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/jayshun2/Cloud-Resume-Challenge)| The Cloud Resume Challenge is a full-stack cloud engineering project that guides you through building and deploying a personal resume website entirely in the cloud. It involves using services like AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB to create a secure, scalable, and dynamic site. You write infrastructure as code with tools like Terraform and automate deployments with GitHub Actions, demonstrating real-world DevOps practices. Designed to showcase your practical skills, the challenge helps you build a professional portfolio project that proves your ability to design and manage cloud infrastructure from end to end. | S3, CloudFront, Route53, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB | In Progress |
| [S3 Static Website](https://github.com/jayshun2/s3StaticWebsite) | The static website at hello.awsportfolio.jayfrench.cloud is a simple, fast-loading personal site hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered securely via CloudFront. | S3, CloudFront, Route53, ACM | Completed |
| [Pre-Signed URLs](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ002-S3PreSignedURL) | The pre-signed URL project uses the AWS CLI to generate secure, time-limited URLs that grant temporary access to private objects stored in an S3 bucket. The project demonstrates how to control access at the object level using pre-signed URLs directly from the command line, showing how AWS handles fine-grained access without making the files public. | S3, IAM, AWS CLI | Completed |
| [EC2 SSH](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ003-EC2_SSH) | This project walks through launching a Linux-based EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and securely connecting to it via SSH. This is a foundational skill for anyone getting started with AWS or cloud infrastructure. You'll gain practical experience with virtual machines, secure access control, and basic network configuration in the AWS environment. | EC2, VPC, Security Groups, Key Pairs | Completed |
| [VPC Public and Private Subnets](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ004-VPC-Subnets) | Create a secure and scalable AWS network using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets. This project demonstrates how to separate internet-facing resources from internal infrastructure using best practices like NAT gateways, route tables, and subnet isolation. | VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway (IGW), NAT Gateway, Route Tables, EC2 | Completed |
| [IAM Access - GUI, CLI, and Terraform](https://github.com/jayshun2/PRJ005-iam-access) | This repository contains three implementationsâ€”GUI, CLI, and Terraformâ€”for creating IAM users, groups, and roles with fine-grained permissions in AWS. Each version demonstrates a different way to manage secure access control using best practices. | IAM, AWS CLI, Terraform | In Progress, Delivery by 8/2/2025 |
